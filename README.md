## Leveraging Deep Representations of Radiology Reports in Survival Analysis for Predicting Heart Failure Patient Mortality

### Data Description

*Note*: All dates are relative days after randomization

#### The subjects table

* `subject_id`: a unique identifier which specifies an individual patient.
* `death_date`: date of death for the given patient as days after randomization.
* `last_followup`: date of the most recent followup as days after randomization.
* `event`: event indicator. True means the subject is decreased.
* `time-to-event`: observable time of a right censored subject. If `event` is True, `time_to_event` is survival days after the last ordering report; otherwise, it is the days between last ordering report and `last_followup`.
* `fold_index`: k-fold for the purpose of cross validation.

#### The reports table

* `subject_id`: a unique identifier which specifies an individual patient.
* `report_id`: a unique identifier which specifies a CT report.
* `ordering_date`: date of the ordering as days after randomization.

#### Reports label sets

* `report_id`: a unique identifier which specifies a CT report.
* `label set 1`: labels generated by ([Pandey et al., 2020]( https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236827)).
* `label set 2`: labels generated by [CheXbert](https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/CheXbert).
* `chexbert hidden`: embeddings by [CheXbert](https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/CheXbert).
* `biobert hidden`: embeddings by [BioBert](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert).
* `bluebert hidden`: embeddings by [BlueBert](https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/bluebert) base.
* `bertbase hidden`: embeddings by Bert base.

### Code Description

#### Install Dependencies

The package list is available in requirements.txt. Run the command below to install the packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Commands
After the dependency installation, train.py can be used to perform the experiments. There are five required arguments for the command:
* ```--timeline```: path to the file containing the subjects table
* ```--mapping```: path to the file containing the reports table
* ```--feature_path```: path to the file containing features
* ```--model```: model specification - coxph, deepsurv, or lstm_cox
* ```--feature_set```: feature specification - label, hidden, or hidden_sequence

```sh
python train.py --timeline {file path} --mapping {file path} --feature_path {file path} \
  --model {coxph, deepsurv, lstm_cox} --feature_set {label, hidden, hidden_sequence}
```
